# RESTfulBlogApp

The RESTful Blog App is a web application developed using MongoDB, Nodejs, Express, EJS and Semantic UI.

The idea behind this project is to follow REST (Representational State Transfer) for HTTP routes and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy/Delete).

The database is hosted on mlab and the styles were done using the CSS library Semantic UI.
